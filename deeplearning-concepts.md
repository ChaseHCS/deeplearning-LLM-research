### Fundamental equation

```txt
ŷ = log(x1w1 + x2w2)
```
`ŷ` is the predictive value of Y. `log` is a place holder for any non-linear function.`x1 and x2` are inputs, for example hours studied when calculating chance that student will pass. `w1 and w2` are weightings behind inputs, for example hours studied would have heavy weighting.

### ANN Artificial Neural Networks

`ANNs` essentially comprise of bricks of this fundamental equation.
